# Plot Creation and Editing Enhancements - Implementation Complete

## âœ… **Hover Behavior Fixed**
- **Problem**: Dotted line was following the mouse cursor on hover
- **Solution**: Modified `handleMapMouseMove` to only track hover point when actively drawing (after first click)
- **Result**: Preview line now only appears after clicking points, providing cleaner drawing experience

## âœ… **Enhanced Plot Creation Dialog**
Created comprehensive `EnhancedPlotDialog.tsx` with:

### **Dual Mode Operation**
1. **Create New Plot**: Traditional plot creation with full field support
2. **Connect to Existing Plot**: Connect polygons to existing plots without coordinates

### **Extended Fields Support**
- Street Address
- Homebuilder (dropdown populated from API)
- Construction Type (dropdown with Timber Frame/Blockwork)
- Unit Type (dropdown with house types)
- Number of Beds/Storeys
- Square Footage
- Minimum Sale Price (Â£)
- Description, Contractor, Notes

### **Smart Plot Connection**
- Lists existing plots without polygon coordinates
- Allows connecting drawn polygons to existing data records
- Prevents data duplication

## âœ… **API Enhancements**

### **Enhanced `/api/plots/create` Route**
- Supports both new plot creation and existing plot connection
- Handles all extended fields
- Calculates polygon center automatically
- Updates existing plots with polygon data when connecting

### **Enhanced `/api/plots/[id]` Route**
- PUT operation now supports all extended fields
- Maintains backward compatibility

### **Data Loading Updates**
- `MapView` now loads both plots with and without polygons
- Populates dropdown for plot connection feature
- Maintains existing polygon rendering

## âœ… **User Experience Improvements**

### **Cleaner Drawing Interface**
- No more distracting hover lines
- Preview only shows during active drawing
- More professional and intentional feel

### **Comprehensive Plot Management**
- Single dialog handles both creation scenarios
- Rich form with all business-relevant fields
- Master data dropdowns for consistency
- Validation for required fields

### **Flexible Workflow Support**
- Create plots with full details upfront
- Connect polygons to existing plot records
- Batch operations for efficiency

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Component Architecture**
- `EnhancedPlotDialog`: New comprehensive creation/connection modal
- Maintains `PlotModal` for viewing/editing existing plots
- Clean separation of concerns

### **State Management**

- Enhanced create/update endpoints
- Master data API consumption

## ðŸŽ¯ **Business Value**

### **Workflow Efficiency**
- Reduces duplicate data entry
- Supports both planned and as-built workflows
- Enables data-first or geometry-first approaches

### **Data Completeness**
- Captures all business-relevant plot information
- Links to master data for consistency
- Supports comprehensive reporting

### **User Flexibility**
