## ✅ Optimization Complete

### 1. Image Compression
```bash
# Using ImageMagick (install from https://imagemagick.org/)
magick "Welbourne - Dashwood.png" -quality 85 -resize 2048x1536 "Welbourne - Dashwood-optimized.jpg"

# Using online tools:
# - TinyPNG.com

# - ImageOptim (Mac)
```

### 2. Progressive Loading
The app now implements:
- ✅ Image preloading
- ✅ Loading progress indicator
- ✅ Fallback pattern if image fails
- ✅ Smooth transitions

### 3. Further Optimizations
- Convert to WebP format (smaller file size)
- Create multiple resolutions for responsive design
- Consider using a CDN for image delivery

## Performance Improvements Made
1. **Preload Management**: Image loads in background while showing progress
2. **Fallback Pattern**: Grid pattern shows if image fails to load
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: UI renders as soon as data is ready
4. **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for better user experience
5. **Loading States**: Clear feedback during loading process
